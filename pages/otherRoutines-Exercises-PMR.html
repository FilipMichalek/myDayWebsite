                <li><p>Tense the muscles of your toes and feet. </p><p>Concentrate on feeling them scrunch up as tightly as possible. Hold for four to 10 seconds, inhaling as you do so. </p></li>
                <li><p>Exhale and completely release the tension in your muscles. </p><p>Breathe slowly through your nose and out through your mouth for another 10 to 20 seconds, focusing on feeling that muscle group and your body sink down. (Donâ€™t worry about the clock or being strict on timing; the point here is to relax.)</p></li>
                <li><p>Repeat step 2 for the rest of your muscle groups: </p><p>calves, thighs, hips, butt, core, back, shoulders, biceps, chest, forearms, hands, neck, around the eyes, and jaw. (If you prefer, you can do PMR in the reverse order, moving from the head down, or in any other sequence.)</p></li>
                <li><p>As you move through the muscle groups, notice any areas of your body that holding extra tension. </p><p>Try maximally squeezing and then releasing, as many times as necessary to fully relax.</p></li>
